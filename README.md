## Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its configuration, including features such as CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, display size, and brand.
## Features

- Developed a laptop price prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm and performed EDA on 1100 rows of data from Kaggle.

- Conducted extensive data manipulation and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modelling.

- Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 88.7% through rigorous testing and validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

- Accurately forecasted laptop prices based on key features, helping users make informed purchasing decisions.
